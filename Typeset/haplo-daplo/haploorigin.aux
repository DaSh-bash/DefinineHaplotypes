(A) A mutation with advantage 10\% arose in a population of 400 haploid individuals, and swept to fixation in 110 generations, at which time 20 genomes were sampled; 20cM of the genome is followed back in time, with the selected locus at the left.; dashed lines (T1 - T4) show times when the favoured allele was in 1 copy, at 10\%, at 50\%, and at 90\% (110, 53, 38, 22 generations back). (B) shows genealogies at positions 0, 1.3cM, 5.3cM, and 20cM, branches are coloured in red when on the fitter background, and black when on the ancestral background. Thus, changes in colour show recombination events that change the genomic background. Note that such events are unlikely when the allele is near fixation (i.e., at the base of the tree, below the lower dashed line), and conversely, become common whilst the allele is rare, simply because it will almost always meet with the opposite background. Before the mutation occurs (i.e., above the upper dashed line) lineages must either trace back to that mutation (top left) or recombine out into the ancestral background; thus, all lineages must appear black above the upper dashed line (110 generations back). Note that the disjunct branches in trees 2 - 4 all coalesce further back in time, but only 200 generations are shown for visibility. (C) shows SNPs along the 20 sampled genomes. The 9 of the most substantial branches are shown. (These have more than 8 descendants, formed by coalescence more recently than the sweeping mutation, and have areas $>0.5$). The red block at the left shows the region linked to the selected locus, which coalesces in a single common ancestor 69 generations back, just after the sweeping mutation arose. Grey dots show those SNPs that are not on these 9 highlighted branches. (D) shows the time back to the most recent common ancestry (TMRCA) along the genome, on a log scale. The bold line shows the example simulated above, whilst the three grey lines show replicates, generated conditional on the same sweep; the break in the line shows an area where the TMRCA extends further back than the extent of the y-axis. The dashed line across the plot corresponds to T1 in panel A.} \relax }}{17}{figure.5}}

(A) Genealogical trees at each genomic point, marked by arrows and corresponding numbers. \emph  {Red} labels - \emph  {H. e. lativitta} samples; \emph  {Yellow} labels: \emph  {H. e. notabilis} samples. Branches on trees are coloured according to the corresponding edges in \emph  {C}. Both highland \emph  {H. e. notabilis} population ($2n = 20$) and lowland \emph  {H .e. lativitta} ($2n = 20$) are included in the analysis so that we can estimate the length of branches that are ancestral to all \emph  {H. e. lativitta} samples ($2n = 20$), however \emph  {B,C,D} only exhibits features related to H. e. lativitta population. (B) Genomic location of SNPs for all 20 \emph  {H. e. lativitta} haploid samples. Out of a total of 137 SNPs, only those that explain the 6 substantial edges are coloured accordingly. Edges are defined as substantial if 3 or more SNPs occur on them. 2 out of 6 edges (\emph  {v} and \emph  {vi}) are explained by doubleton SNPs, whereas the rest are fixed within the \emph  {H. e. lativitta} samples. SNPs that do not appear on any significant edge are coloured grey if they have higher allele frequency within the samples, white otherwise. (C) Visualisation of haplotype blocks as edges similar to Figure 3 - plotting blocks along the genomic (x-axis) and temporal span (y-axis). Since edges always originate at a fixed coalescent time point, the bottom line of the block is always smooth. The ragged tops of the blocks denote the length of the edges interrupted by recombination events. Note that edges can also be disjunct due to one or more samples and recombining out and back into the same lineage.
