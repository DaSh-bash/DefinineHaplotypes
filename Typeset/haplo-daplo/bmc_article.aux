(B) shows genealogies at positions 0, 1.3cM, 5.3cM, and 20 cM, branches are coloured in red when on the fitter background, and black when on the ancestral background. Thus, changes in colour show recombination events that change the genomic background. Note that such events are unlikely when the allele is near fixation (i.e., at the base of the tree, below the lower dashed line), and conversely, become common whilst the allele is rare, simply because it will almost always meet with the opposite background. Before the mutation occurs (i.e., above the upper dashed line) lineages must either trace back to that mutation (top left) or recombine out into the ancestral background; thus, all lineages must appear black above the upper dashed line (110 generations back). Note that the disjunct branches in trees 2 - 4 all coalesce further back in time, but only 200 generations are shown for visibility. (C) shows SNPs along the 20 sampled genomes.
